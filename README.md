# iFlowBench

iFlowBench is an open test suite for evaluating the effectiveness of data-flow analysis tools, specifically for Objective-C binaries. This suite provides both the source code and pre-compiled versions of multiple test cases, allowing users to avoid the need for proprietary software and hardware for compilation. 

## Open for contributions!

**You are most welcome to contribute to iFlowBench testcase collection.** To do so, please fork the project, commit your changes for the main.m, update this README and then send us a pull request.
